Pointers

Pointing to

int a = 5;
int *b = &a; declares a pointer. Need the asterik
b = &a; declares the address of a, because pointers can only hold addresses. This assigns the 		pointer a value

b stores the address of a, lets say its 1002.

We learned about arrays because they have a fixed size. Once a size is defined you cannot change size. Dynamic Memory Allocation. Pointers achieve direct access to memory. Will learn DMA to overcome the fixed size obstacle.

Character

char ' '

A string is a set of characters or array of characters

Command line arguments:

cp -source -destination : Copy
emacs -filename.c -destination : Emacs
vim -filename.c  -destination : Vim

char * argv[], int argc // argument vector and count respectively

char argv only holds one character
so we use char *argv pointer to get a string
char *argv[] is an array of pointers
