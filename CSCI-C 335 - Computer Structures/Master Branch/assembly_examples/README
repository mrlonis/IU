Simple examples for C335.  These demonstrate the use of C as a testbench, QEMU for
simulation, and GDB for debugging.   Change to an example directory

make       -->   builds .elf file, .lst files with disassemble code for each .s
make test  --> builds, runs qemu
make debug --> builds, runs qemu + gdb

When executing the simulator (qemu) under gdb, you can step into and set breakpoints in assembly files.  The ARM registers are all 
accesible as in "print $r0" to print the contents of register r0.
