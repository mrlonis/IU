Q1. What is the significance of the peripheral base address? Where does it point?

Set SPI base address is the address to the SPI data register.

Q2. Why is it necessary to enable incrementing as was done in this step? What will the DMA controller do in response to this configuration.

Incrementing was done so that all read/writes are from a single DR register.

Q3. Why is this line of the code necessary?

To wait for completion of DMA

Q4. For transfers of less than 4 bytes, what do you think is the reason for not using the xchng_datablock functions?

4 bytes is a small amount and would be better to process normally so as to keep the CPU not idle for so long

Q5. Why is it important for the DMA controller and the audio player to work on differnt portions of Audiobuf.

So that audio can constantly be buffered in so it plays and sounds normal

6. Difficulties & What I Learned:

SD card was a pain in the but AND NO ONE SPECIFIED THAT THE AUDIO FILES HAVE TO HAVE A SMAPLE RATE OF 11025 KBPS AND A BIT-DEPTH OF 8!!!! MADE THIS LAB ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.

I learned how to make 11025 8-bit wav files
