What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?

Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high or high to low?

How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus?

The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?

Does a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler (master)? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?

Describe what you learned and any difficulties you had [5]:
