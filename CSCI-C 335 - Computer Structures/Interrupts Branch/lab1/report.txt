Results: 

I accomplished a successful setup of GitHub. I was aided by
 my experience in CSCI-C 291 and found this to be very easy for me. I
 also successfully built a 'Hello world!' program as well as an
 Icebreaker Hello World program that includes some "crazy" code. I
 simply just added math calculations because I didn't really have any
 ideas at the time and nor did my partner.

Difficulties: 

I had some difficulty compiling my icebreaker.c code
 because I had imported the math.h header in my file. However, I kept 
receiving errors from gcc when I ran gcc -o icebreaker icebreaker.c.
 I was told I have undefined references, despite importing the math.h 
header. Turns out I needed to add a -lm to the end of my gcc statement 
in order to link the math library.

What I've learned: 

I learned today who my lab instructors are. I also 
learned to add a -lm to the end of any gcc statement in which the code 
that needs to be compiled references functions in the math.h header.
