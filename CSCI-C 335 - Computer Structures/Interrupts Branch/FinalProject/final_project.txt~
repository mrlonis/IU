Final Project

By Matthew Lonis & Alvaro Michael

The game we made for this project is a tower defense games. We drew our inspiration from games like Bloons Tower Defense 5 or many of the other clones that exist out in the market today.

The core functionality of our game focuses around user input and whether or not the game is paused or not. If the game is paused, the user input is at the forefront of focus for the game. 

When the game is paused, the user will be to move around with a selection that highlights things white. The user will always start out in tower selection mode in which they can select along the bottom part of the screen which tower they would like to select. If and only if user input is detect, will the game do something while paused which makes the controls feel snappy and keep the game responsive.

When the game isn't paused, the towers (setup by the user) and the enemies (pre-built in an array whenever a new round starts), move and attack. If a tower reaches the end of the red path, the player loses a life. If the players life equals 0, the game is over and the credits pop-up, playing thermo.wav and detailing on the LCD who made the game.
