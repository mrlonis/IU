In order to make the Android Link function correctly, go into csciA290AndroidFragment.java and change the string variable (project1URL) at the top to this URL:

- 

The reason for this is because I did not upload to GitHub until i was 100% done with this assignment.

Other than that, everything else should work as is. All the pictures have been imported and all libraries are ones built into the Android Studio. In case something doesn’t work the only import I could see being an issue is android.support.v4.app.Fragment.

Before you begin grading, its import for me to say this. My original design intention was too have a project page that implements a Master/Detail Flow as shown in my Phase 2. However, I did not realize the extreme difficulty of trying to do this inside a navigation drawer, and in order to finish my project in any reasonable time, I had to purely use fragments to accomplish this, with each course getting its own fragment. I hope this doesn’t change too much, however i know going forward to at least THOROUGHLY investigate how difficult something will be before proposing it.

Thanks!
