/*
Consider the following code fragment when embedded in a complete program.
if (x > 3) {
 if (x <= 5)
   y = 1;
 else if (x != 6)
   y = 2;
} else
 y = 3;
Assume that x has a value of 6 at the beginning of fragment.
What value does the variable y hold after the fragment gets executed? Why?

Same question if you remove the curly braces. Explain your answer(s).
