Problem 1:

- The output is 1 1 2 2 3 3 because each iteration of alpha.fun(); makes a and b go up by 1 unit.

Problem 2:

- The output is "1 1 1 1 2 2" without quotation marks.
- This is because beta.fun isn't related to alpha.fun yet it produces the same result as the first occurence of alpha.fun

Problem 3:

- It produces "1 1 1 2 2 3" without the quotation marks
- This is because b is a static integer which will stay the same throughout alpha.fun and beta.fun

Problem 4:

- We get option (a); the program does not compile
- 1 error found:

Error: The constructor Four(int) is undefined

- We have defined Four to accept no arguments so when we say new Four(3), the compiler gives out the error that Four(int) is undefined because technically it is.

Problem 5:

- We get option (c); compiles and outputs 3 0
- This is because we defined both a Five(); and a Five(int);

Problem 6:

- We get option (e); compiles and outputs 3 3.
- This is because we aren't accessing the fields in a static way
- value is a static variable, holding its value regardless
- After Six beta = new Six(3), alpha.value and beta.value equals 3

Problem 7:

- We get (b); compiles and produces 0 0
- This is because we initialized the static int value but never gave it a value to hold so the variable exists it just doesn't have a value. Since it doesn't have a value, when we call alpha.value or beta.value it defaults to zero because thats the default value for an integer.
