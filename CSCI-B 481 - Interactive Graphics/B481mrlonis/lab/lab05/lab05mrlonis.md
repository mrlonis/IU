Questions for Assignment 1

1. Is the default data structure (array) used to store vertex information okay or should I use something different? I'm not too familiar with swift so I don't know my options.

- Answer: Use the array structure provided in the template code. You can add data to it using functions like append and remove.

2. What are the E_MODE_INSERT and other modes on the website? Are they variables?

- Answer: Make them functions rather than modes. Call proximity detection first and based on its answer you'll know what mode you are in.

3. How do I enable the drawing of vertexs?

- Answer: Make another for loop and change the primitives. Then go to shader.vsh and uncomment the line glPointSize.
