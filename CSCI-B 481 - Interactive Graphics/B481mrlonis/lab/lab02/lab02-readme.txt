I worked on this lab by initially drawing my squares, and then writing out psuedo-code I would use to draw the squares on my paper. I utilized this process for drawing squares.

I started by creating the square with default size of 1 and at the top left corner of the origin. Then, I would scale the square to the correct rectangle. Then, I would translate the rectangles. Then i would rotate them. I did this for eight square rectangles.
