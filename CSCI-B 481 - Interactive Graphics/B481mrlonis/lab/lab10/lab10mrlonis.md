## color_theory Demos

### additive_color_mixing.jar
1. Which Computer Graphics topic is presented?
    - Additive color mixing using RGB colors. Red & green make yellow, blue & red make purple, and green & blue make cyan.
2. Which equation/algorithm does this individual demo implement/present?
    - This demo implements a mixing of colors using additon.
3. How is this demo controlled by the user?
    - Mouse clicks and buttons to select what color you would like to draw on the black box.
4. What is the user interaction (with user output) provided by this individual demo, how is it controlled by the user, and what is the demo output in response to the user input?
    - The demo responds by showing bars for the amount of RGB values for each channel when the user hovers over a drawn color so they can understand what makes up a color.

### combined_color_mixing.jar
1. Which Computer Graphics topic is presented?
    - Combined color mixing.
2. Which equation/algorithm does this individual demo implement/present?
    - Matrix multiplication & color addition.
3. How is this demo controlled by the user?
    - User clicks on lights to select a light bulb color, clicks on paints to paint the canvas reflecting the light, and click on a filter to filter the reflected light.
4. What is the user interaction (with user output) provided by this individual demo, how is it controlled by the user, and what is the demo output in response to the user input?
    - The demo shows what the user would really see (signified by the human head) based on all the set parameters.
