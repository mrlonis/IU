The x-y coordinate system for Xcode seems to be identical to OpenGL's as far as the x-coordinates go. The y-coordinates are completely different and seem to be about 400-450 values off (Xcode being the higher number). I'm guessing OpenGL puts the 0 value for the y-coordinate at the bottom of the screen and Xcode puts the 0 value for the y-coordinate at the top.

When you rotate or resize the screen, the line stays in its same "relative" position as it was when in regular non-resized portrait mode.
