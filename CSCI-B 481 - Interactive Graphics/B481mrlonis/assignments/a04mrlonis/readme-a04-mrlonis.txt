## What is currently **NOT** working

I am missing my obj3.

I have lighting working however there are some issues with is such as I don't know if it is per-vertex or per-fragment. Also, the lighting won't light up objects when rotated (in other words the light rotates with the objects and camera) however I don't think its working when I translate my camera.

I am also missing texture mapping.

Camera motion also is only using a rotation, scaling, and translation matrix rather than something more complex like the lookAt function.

## What **IS** currently working

Interaction between obj1 and obj2.

Animation (obj2 rotates about a circle).

Lighting. However, based on above it may need some further fine tuning.

Camera motion. However, based on above, I need to make it use something more advanced like a lookAt function.
