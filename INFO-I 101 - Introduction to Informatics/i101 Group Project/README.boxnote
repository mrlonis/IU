I just joined your group today and added a bunch of changes to your HTML pages. If you look in the <head> tags there are a bunch of new <meta> tags. Leave those alone. They will help the website display well on a mobile device (like your iPhone). On your iPhone, or any smartphone, if you have the Box app, click the .html files and you'll see what they look like on a mobile device [Now tell me we won't get an A+ ;)] If any of my changes seem too aburd let me know. Oh also, i deleted some files you guys weren't using and reorganized a whole bunch. Looking forward to the next meeting!\n\nIf you need to contact me or anyone I'll start a contact note here:\n\nMatthew Lonis\nPhone: 317-902-0228\nEmail: mattlonis@gmail.com (I hate the IU email system)\n\nPlease explain what exactly it is we are doing and what our solution is down below. I missed Tuesday's class:\n\nWe have scenario 3 and what you see in the files is basically our current brainstorming.\n\nThe idea is to identify students with financial need who do not have computers and allow them a short-term or long-term loan of a computer. Laptop only for short-term, desktop option for long-term.\n\nWe cannot have the university finance the computers for this program so we will be asking local business to donate old tech which we will then format to a uniform build. Business would benefit from tax breaks and hopefully the university could develop a relationship with that business in the process.\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TVWMGRK please send this out to your peers so we can gather outside input. \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-VS7ZCKKT/ survey results\n\nCan we still have more people take the survey? - Hell yeah!\n\n","attribs":"*4+r*4*5*6+5*4+f*4*5*6+k*4|2+2*4+3r*4*5*6+1*4+4*4*5*6+1*4+d*4*5*6+5*4+d*4*5*6+1*4+4*4*5*6+1*4+5*4*5*6+7*4+2k*4*5*6+4s*4+2x*4*5*6+1*4|8+6a*4*5*6+31*4|1+1*8|1+1*8*5*6+2g*8|2+2*8*5*6+5h*8|2+2*8*5*6+8d*8|2+2*8*9+12*8*5*6+1w*8|1+1*8*a+1d*8*5*6+f*8|1+1*4|1+1*4*5*6+1a*8*5*6+d*8|1+1|1+1","opCount":42,"appliedAttribsCount":79,"maxAttribsOnSingleOp":3},"pool":{"numToAttrib":{"0":["author","a.4fz9s4pIrvcRKF5l"],"1":["align","left"],"2":["insertorder","first"],"3":["lmkr","1"],"4":["author","264312997"],"5":["font-color-000000","true"],"6":["font-size-medium","true"],"7":["removed","true"],"8":["author","185696776"],"9":["link-MTQ2NTUyNDE2MDczNC1odHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXJ2ZXltb25rZXkuY29tL3IvVFZXTUdSSw==","true"],"10":["link-MTQ2NTU2NjQwNzc1OS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5zdXJ2ZXltb25rZXkuY29tL3Jlc3VsdHMvU00tVlM3WkNLS1Qv","true"]},"nextNum":11},"chatHead":-1,"publicStatus":false,"passwordHash":null,"savedRevisions":[]}
